# RasPiNet - Development Code of Conduct
## Purpose

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## General Conduct

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## General Structure

RasPiNet is maintained under the DeCodeMo organization. The Master branch of the RasPiNet folder will be kept deployable. Child branches will be used to develop specific functionalities. No merge should take place to the master branch before it has been reviewed and approved by official maintainers. A reasonable response time for a review is ***72 hours***. If the review has not been completed, contact the administrators here or in the RasPiNet discord server.
 
## GitHub Projects Board

The project board is under the DeCodeMo Organization page. This is where tasks are tracked and managed. boards can be built for specific subprojects but the main communication hub is here. As we go along this will get easier, its essential to establish a rhythm and flow to produce a good product. 

## Collaborators 

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Collaborators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting Admin on the discord server. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. 

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions by Admin or the code owner.
